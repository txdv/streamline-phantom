# streamline-phantom

This is a [streamline](https://github.com/Sage/streamlinejs) wrapper for [phantom](https://github.com/alexscheelmeyer/node-phantom).

It essentially just changes the callback style of the phantom API to (error, result).
Therefore it can be used without streamline, but streamline depends on this code back style.
